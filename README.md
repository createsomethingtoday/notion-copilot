## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- TypeScript 4.5+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Notion API Key
- OpenAI API Key (coming soon)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notion-assistant.git
cd notion-assistant
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
# Backend configuration
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your settings

# Frontend configuration
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
# Edit frontend/.env with your settings
```

4. Initialize database:
```bash
# Create and set up database
cd backend
npm run db:init

# Optional: Seed test data
npm run db:seed
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Development

### Database Management
```bash
# Initialize database
npm run db:init

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Rollback last migration
npm run db:rollback

# Seed test data
npm run db:seed
```

### Building
```bash
# Build backend
cd backend
npm run build

# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- Task Queue: Manages task lifecycle and execution
- Priority Manager: Handles task scheduling and ordering
- Concurrency Manager: Controls parallel execution and rate limits
- Metrics Collector: Tracks performance and system health
- PostgreSQL Adapter: Handles data persistence and transactions

### Design Principles
- Reliability: No task loss, guaranteed execution
- Scalability: Handle increasing load gracefully
- Observability: Full system visibility
- Efficiency: Optimal resource utilization
- Data Integrity: ACID compliance for all operations
