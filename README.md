# Notion Assistant

An AI-powered assistant that helps users manage and interact with their Notion workspace through natural language conversations.

## Overview

Notion Assistant is an intelligent system that combines a chat interface with an AI agent to help users accomplish tasks in their Notion workspace. Users can simply describe what they want to do, and the assistant will handle the execution through Notion's API.
