# Notion Assistant

An AI-powered assistant that helps users manage and interact with their Notion workspace through natural language conversations.

## Overview

Notion Assistant is an intelligent system that combines a chat interface with an AI agent to help users accomplish tasks in their Notion workspace. Users can simply describe what they want to do, and the assistant will handle the execution through Notion's API.

## Features

- ü§ñ Natural language task processing
- üí¨ Interactive chat interface
- üîÑ Real-time task progress updates
- üîê Secure Notion workspace integration
- üìù Support for various Notion operations
- üéØ Context-aware task execution
- üìä Task history and tracking

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "socket.io-client": "^4.7.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.0",
    "@notionhq/client": "^2.2.0"
  }
}
```

### Backend
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.7.0",
    "@notionhq/client": "^2.2.0",
    "openai": "^4.0.0",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.0",
    "redis": "^4.6.0",
    "mongoose": "^7.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```env
   NOTION_CLIENT_ID=your_notion_client_id
   NOTION_CLIENT_SECRET=your_notion_client_secret
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
   ```
4. Run database migrations
5. Start development servers

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT-based user authentication
- Secure session management
- OAuth 2.0 flow for Notion integration
- Regular token rotation

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data

- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

### Monitoring
- Error logging
- Activity auditing
- Performance monitoring
- Rate limit tracking

## Notion API Integration

### Workspace Access
